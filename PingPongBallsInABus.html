  		Q: How many ping pong balls would it take to fill an average-sized school bus? Describe each step in your thought process.
	</p>
  
	<p>
		I estimate that roughly 734,622 ping pong balls would fit in an averaged size school bus.</p>
	<p>

Thought Process: </p>

<p>

Off the top of my head I know neither the average size of a school bus nor the size of a ping pong ball. I surmise that the bus will be narrower than a lane of traffic which I know to be 12’ and the ball to be somewhere around 1.5 inches in diameter. </p>

<p>
Since I do not know any reasonable measurements at this point I first try to set up a basic equation which in my head looked like this: 
</p>

<p>
Bus interior width*height*length/(ball diameter^3/12^3) - seats, obstructions, kids, whatever else is inside the bus</p>

<p>
I decided to go with defining the balls as cubes since the question seems to imply we’re looking for the fewest number of balls it would take to fill the bus. It’s also simpler to think about cubes. 
</p>

<p>
At this point I actually went and found some numbers so I would get a semi-realistic result.  During this task I learned a lot of things too trivial to be called trivia, but I am tickled that the current size of ping pong balls was once the subject of international controversy and allegations of racism. 
</p>

<p>
This is what my equation looked like with numbers for the interior of the bus plugged in. I went with these because they looked reasonable when compared to my estimates of how large a bus exterior would be (Thanks dimensionsguide.com): 
</p>

<p>
6.5’ * 7.5’ * 35’ / 1.52^3/12^3 –obstructions = 839,567
</p>

<p>
To estimate the seats I imagined the school buses I’ve been on with their seats all mashed up and compacted to the back. In my head this looked like they took up about 1/8th of the interior volume, so I went with that.

 839567 – 104945 = 734,622
